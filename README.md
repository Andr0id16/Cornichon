# Cornichon
A small Gherkin DSL parser that has evolved from a CodeProject article:
["A Slice of Cucumber"](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1084071/A-Slice-of-Cucumber).

The code comprises a Python script which reads in a feature file and produces stub code
against a given test framework. This allows BDD to be integrated into new and existing
projects without the need to depend on [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/).
